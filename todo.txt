This is a global todo file for the entire project..


Should have done :


Now :
> remove escape key from valid keyrange
> redo makefileS ( Test folder : Currently in .gitignore )
	Ideas :
	- Use base makefile as a source
	- Use lists
	- Have global methods ( %o : %c )
	- Comment

Future :
> Create class structure
